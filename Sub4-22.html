        <b>AP Computer Science Agenda: </b><br>
        All wonderful classes, maybe light reminder to work on something.<br>
        1. Students will have free time to work on Lab 70. That should take the entire duration of the period.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Intro to Engineering Agenda: </b><br>
        This class does get loud and chaotic at some points. <br>
        1. Students will work all period on their website update. This will be posted to Google Classroom for everyone to complete. That is all they need to do this period.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <b>For Period 1 and 2 Homeroom:</b> Students can chill for homeroom.
        <!--<b>For Period 2 Homeroom:</b> The Panorama Survey has been posted to Google Classroom. They must complete this survey.<br>-->

      <h1><b>Behavior</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Hall Pass:</b> Usually I let one student out at a time for the restroom. There is a computer kiosk that every student should sign out of on the computer cart.<br><br>

        Generally, students should be pretty well behaved and should be <b>working on their labs</b>. <br>
        <br>
        Students may be on their phones during class and I'm generally fine with that. If anything, you're welcome to remind them to work on labs to keep pushing forward in content.
        <br><br>
        <b>Period 7:</b> This is probably the loudest period. They may get off task, just try to remind lightly to be working on their websites.
