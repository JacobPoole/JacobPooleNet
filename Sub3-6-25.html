        <b>Honors Software Internship Agenda:</b><br>
        This class is pretty independent and not much to worry about.<br>
        They're currently working in 2 large groups with their own leadership in both. They know what they need to work on.<br>
        <br>

        <b>AP Computer Science Agenda: </b><br>
        All wonderful classes, maybe light reminder to work on labs/homework.<br>
        1. Please have them open Google Classroom to watch the Selection Sort Video<br>
        2. Each pair/trio will use the cards on the desks to practice Selection Sort 3 different ways (Ace-King Shuffle, Reverse Ace-King, Duplicates)<br>
        3. Once done, they can work on their lab due on Friday 3/7 and Homework due this Sunday 3/9.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Intro to Engineering Agenda: </b><br>
        This class does get loud and chaotic at some points. <br>
        1. Each group should be working on their Egg Drop project. This means they do get up and work.<br>
        2. Students can take from the materials at the front of the classroom as needed. They are limited in how much tape they can use though, maximum of 3 feet.<br>
        3. They will be working with scissors and knives, please make sure they are using the hardboard when working with knives.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <b>For Period 2 Homeroom:</b> Students can chill for homeroom.
        <!--<b>For Period 2 Homeroom:</b> The Panorama Survey has been posted to Google Classroom. They must complete this survey.<br>-->

      <h1><b>Behavior</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Hall Pass:</b> Usually I let one student out at a time for the restroom. There is a pass on the computer cart by the door.<br><br>

        Generally, students should be pretty well behaved and should be <b>working on their labs</b>. <br>
        <br>
        Students may be on their phones during class and I'm generally fine with that. If anything, you're welcome to remind them to work on labs to keep pushing forward in content.
        <br><br>
        <b>Period 7:</b> This is probably the loudest period. They may get off task, just try to remind lightly to be working on their websites.
