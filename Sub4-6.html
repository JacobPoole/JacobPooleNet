        <b>Honors Software Internship Agenda:</b><br>
        This class is pretty independent and not much to worry about. <br>
        <b>Please have this class help clean up the tables of the engineering projects. There should be a foldable table at the front of the classroom that projects can be set on top of. </b><br>
        1. They can work on their labs<br>
        2. They can work on their independent project. <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>AP Computer Science Agenda: </b><br>
        Majority of classes shouldn't have a problem.<br>
        1. They will complete an online exercise posted on Google Classroom<br>
        2. Work on last HW and labs.<br>
        3. Quiz at the end of the period, posted on Google Classroom. <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>Intro to Engineering Agenda: </b><br>
        This class does get loud and chaotic at some points. <br>
        <b>Students will not be working on their cars today. No tools should be used.</b><br>
        1. Students should be working on their boat designs. This should be all period.<br>
        <br>
        
        <br>
        <b>For Period 1 Homeroom:</b> Students can chill for homeroom.
        <!--<b>For Period 2 Homeroom:</b> The Panorama Survey has been posted to Google Classroom. They must complete this survey.<br>-->
        <br>

      <h1><b>Behavior</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Hall Pass:</b> Usually I let one student out at a time for the restroom. There's a car that acts as the hall pass that sits next to the tissues at the front of the class. They are also welcome to use the virtual hall pass if the computer is on at the front of the classroom.<br><br>
        
        Generally, students should be pretty well behaved and should be <b>working on their labs</b>. <br>
        <br>
        Students may be on their phones during class and I'm generally fine with that. If anything, you're welcome to remind them to work on labs to keep pushing forward in content.
        <br><br>
        <b>Period 7:</b> This is probably the loudest period. They may get off task, just try to remind lightly to be working on their websites.
        <br>
