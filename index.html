    <p><i>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I currently am working at Applied Medical as an Electrical Engineer. I work with the <a href="https://www.appliedmedical.com/Products/Voyant"> Voyant Intelligent Energy System </a> on the technology and development team.
    I'm looking to transition into more of a management position. I love working with people and enjoy focusing on the future and planning of projects. I think beyond my engineering capabilities, this is where I excel. <br><br>

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I graduated with a computer engineering degree from the University of California, Riverside.
	My emphasis was in embedded systems and I love to create and play with robots. I delved deeper into FPGA acceleration and design by taking a couple graduate courses. I enjoyed some schematic design and PCB layout as well. I was also very involved on campus
	with student organizations which include the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Citrus Hack, Women in Computing, etc. <br><br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With all of these, I also volunteer and mentor my high school robotics team, FIRST FRC Team 589 Falkon Robotics and a Riverside local team FIRST FRC Team 6960, the Rusty Huskies.
	 With them competing in the winter for six weeks to design and build a functioning robot for a given game. I mentor them in programming, electronics and driving. <br> <br>

 	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I've always loved working with kids. That's the reason I ran for outreach chair and program chair in my organizations. In high school, I became a teacher's assistant for a robotics class and fell in love with working with the kids. Just teaching them about engineering and having the learn from me felt so special. I specifically remember multiple times while working withkids on computer science assignments, I would slowly walk them through their error/problem until they suddenly said the word "OHHH" and finally realize how it works. That's when I know I've succeeded. Whenever I help someone or teach someone, that's the moment that I aim for, the "OH" moment. I'd love to teach in the future to inspire the next generation of engineers, but before I do that I'm very excited to join the workforce and enter the industry in embedded systems.  </i>
