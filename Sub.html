      Hello friend!  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Updated last at: 2:52pm - 3/3/2022<br><br>
      Thank you for your help and for substituing for my class! <br>
      If you have questions or need me, feel free to email me at <b><a href="mailto:jpoole@gusd.net">jpoole@gusd.net</a></b> or ask a student to direct message me on <b>Discord</b>.

      <h1><b> Attendance </b></h1>
      <h3>
      At first glance, my class can be a little confusing. There are 3 different classes being taught. <br>
      That means 3 different attendance sheets per period.
      <br><br>
      The following are my periods:<br>
      <b>Period 1: </b> Applied Computer Programming, AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 2: </b> Applied Computer Programming, AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 3: </b> Applied Computer Programming, AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 4: </b> AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Lunch</b><br>
      <b>Period 5: </b> Prep, relax :D<br>
      <b>Period 6: </b> Applied Computer Programming, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 7: </b> Robotics<br>
      <br>
      <b>Weird Attendence:</b><br>
      <b>4th Period,</b> there are 3 students who work in the backroom. They're with me but are on Dr. Neat's Roster. Don't worry about them. <br>
      <b>6th period,</b> Jake Kim is on our roster, have him check if Aaron Strong is present. Aaron sits in Dr. Neat's room for this period. Again there are 2 students (Nikitas and Robert) who work in the back but are on Dr. Neat's Roster.

      <h1><b>Classwork</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Computer Science Students will be working on the following this period: </b><br>
        1. First 20-30 minutes will be working on an exercise posted to <b>Google Classroom.</b> <br>
        2. Next work on Labs or Homework<br>
        3. Studying for the Quiz <br>
        4. <b>Students will ask about a quiz. This quiz is take home and will be posted Friday Afternoon, due Sunday(3/6) 11:59pm</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Robotics Students will be working on the following this period: </b><br>
        1. Updating their Website <br>
        2. Researching for their design project <br>
        <br>
        <b>For Period 2 Homeroom:</b> Ask Students to make sure they've done the Panorama Survey and Sown to Grow.
        <br>
      </h3>

      <h1><b>Behavior</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Hall Pass:</b> Usually I let one student out at a time for the restroom. There's a hall pass that sits next to the tissues at the front of the class.<br><br>
        <b>Period 6:</b> This is probably the loudest period. They may get off task, just try to remind lightly to be working on labs.
        <br><br>
        Generally, students should be pretty well behaved and should be <b>working on their labs</b>. You can ask <b>Super AP's</b> (aka honors students) to help the class out when needed. They're a really good resource for other students when they're stuck on problems. <br>
        <br>
        Students may be on their phones during class and I'm generally fine with that. If anything, you're welcome to remind them to work on labs to keep pushing forward in content.
