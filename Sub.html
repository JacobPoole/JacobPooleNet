      <h1><b> Attendance </b></h1>
      <h3>
      At first glance, my class can be a little confusing. There are 3 different classes being taught. <br>
      That means 3 different attendance sheets per period.
      <br><br>
      The following are my periods:<br>
      <b>Period 1: </b> Applied Computer Programming, AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 2: </b> Applied Computer Programming, AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 3: </b> Applied Computer Programming, AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 4: </b> AP Computer Science, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Lunch</b><br>
      <b>Period 5: </b> Prep, relax :D<br>
      <b>Period 6: </b> Applied Computer Programming, Honors Software Internship<br>
      <b>Period 7: </b> Robotics<br>
      <br>

      <h1><b>Classwork</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Computer Science Students will be working on the following this period: </b><br>
        1. Working on labs <br>
        2. Working on homework <br>
        3. Studying for quizzes <br>
        <br>
        <b>Robotics Students will be working on the following this period: </b><br>
        1. Updating their Website <br>
        2. Researching for their design project <br>
        3. Colin, continue to build his website and add more features to it. <br><br>

        Generally, students should be pretty well behaved and should be <b>working on their labs</b>. You can ask <b>Super AP's</b> (aka honors students) to help the class out when needed. They're a really good resource for other students when they're stuck on problems. <br>
        <br>
        Students may be on their phones during class and I'm generally fine with that. If anything, you're welcome to remind them to work on labs to keep pushing forward in content.
