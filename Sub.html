      <h1><b>Behavior</b></h1>
      <h3>
        <b>Hall Pass:</b> Usually I let one student out at a time for the restroom. There's a car that acts as the hall pass that sits next to the tissues at the front of the class.<br><br>
        
        Generally, students should be pretty well behaved and should be <b>working on their labs</b>. <br>
        <br>
        Students may be on their phones during class and I'm generally fine with that. If anything, you're welcome to remind them to work on labs to keep pushing forward in content.
        <br><br>
        <b>Period 7:</b> This is probably the loudest period. They may get off task, just try to remind lightly to be working on their websites.
